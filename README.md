# Rivalry Research Project

This project is structured as a monorepo containing both the backend logic and the frontend application for the Rivalry Research tool.

## Project Structure

- **backend/**: Contains the Python-based research library and CLI tools. This includes the core logic for fetching data from Wikidata, analyzing rivalries using AI, and storing the results.
- **app/**: Contains the frontend application (in development).

## Getting Started

### Backend

Navigate to the `backend` directory to work with the Python library:

```bash
cd backend
# Follow the instructions in backend/README.md
```

### Frontend

The frontend application is located in the `app` directory.

*(Frontend setup instructions to be added)*
